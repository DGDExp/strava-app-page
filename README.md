# strava-app-page
Landing page for my Strava API application
I am trying to make an automated text message with python that pulls my historical ride data from strava, data from google maps, and another weather service, to tell me average ride time to work using the same route i have taken over the last year. I would also like to pull from Specialized "Globe" app which has ebike commute data, garmin which has duplicates of some of my strava rides.
